1. fix metrics in nn_to_bool_formula:
    - accuracy NN: accuracy of the trained NN on the train dataset
    - accuracy NeuronGraph: should be the same as accuracy NN
    - accuracy BooleanGraph: accuracy of inference rules model on train dataset
    - fidelity NN <-> BooleanGraph: overlap of predictions between NN and BooleanGraph on train dataset
2. expand NOT intialization to str parameter instead of only Literal
